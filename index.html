                    Hi, I'm Chinmoyee, currently pursuing my graduation in Computer Science at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. I come from Brahmanbaria, a small town in Bangladesh, where my family of 14 is deeply rooted in culture and tradition. This upbringing has instilled in me a profound appreciation for various traditional festivals.

                    Apart from my academic pursuits, I have a passion for traveling and exploring diverse cuisines. My love for adventure and food goes hand in hand, allowing me to discover new places and flavors.
               </p>

                    As a Computer Science student, I’m not just focused on my academic courses. I believe in going beyond the curriculum to gain a deeper understanding of my field. Currently, I’m sharpening my problem-solving skills by practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Additionally, I’m enhancing my knowledge by taking web development courses. Below are some free resources that I’ve found helpful for learning DSA and web development:

               <p>For me, traveling works like medicine. Exploring different places, immersing myself in the serenity of nature, spending time with diverse communities, and celebrating their festivals—these experiences are truly unmatched. Personally, I prefer mountains over beaches, as they offer a unique sense of peace and adventure. Here are a few shots from some of my trips.</p>

               <h4>Culinary Adventure</h4>
               <p>i believe that food is not just about satisfying hunger—it brings me a deep sense of inner pleasure. I come from a family that is truly passionate about food, and this love for culinary delights runs in my blood. Whenever I travel, my cousins and I make it a point to discover the best local dishes. Exploring street food in different places is an experience that I cherish.</p>
